## üåç **Homelab Network Architecture**

### **Network Segments:**
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** Public-facing systems and services (e.g., web servers).
- **Internal Network:** Private systems and servers (e.g., internal databases, file servers).
- **VLANs:** Separate internal systems to simulate organizational departments.
- **VPN:** Secure access to your lab for external penetration testing and experiments.

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to get your **CyberSec-Xperience** lab running on **Windows** or **MacBook**:

### 1. **Install Virtualization Software**

First, you need virtualization software to run multiple virtual machines (VMs). This setup works on both **Windows** and **MacBook**.

- **Windows:**
  - Download and install **[VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html)** or **[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)**.
  
- **MacBook:**
  - Download and install **[VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html)** or **[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)**.

### 2. **Download & Install Operating Systems (OS)**

You'll need to download ISO images for the following operating systems:

- **Kali Linux:** The go-to OS for penetration testing. [Download Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
- **Windows Server 2019/2022** or **Windows 10/7** (for vulnerable target systems).
- **Ubuntu Server:** Download [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).
- **pfSense/OPNsense:** Open-source firewalls for creating a secure environment. [Download pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) or [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/download/).

### 3. **Create Virtual Machines (VMs)**

Now that you've installed your virtualization software and downloaded the OS images, it's time to set up the VMs. Here‚Äôs how:

#### **Firewall/Router VM (pfSense or OPNsense):**
- Create a new VM and install **pfSense** or **OPNsense**.
- Configure the network interface to control traffic flow between your VM networks (DMZ, Internal Network, VPN).
- Enable NAT and configure firewall rules to simulate external/internal traffic management.

#### **Penetration Testing VM (Kali Linux/Parrot OS):**
- Install **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS**.
- Once installed, install the tools you'll use for penetration testing (Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, etc.).

#### **Target System VMs (Windows 10, Windows Server, Ubuntu):**
- Install **Windows Server** or **Windows 10** on these VMs to simulate vulnerable systems.
- For testing, you can add known vulnerabilities to these systems (e.g., SMB vulnerabilities, unpatched services).

### 4. **Install Security Monitoring Tools (IDS/IPS, SIEM)**

For security monitoring, use **Splunk** or the **ELK Stack** to collect and analyze logs from all your VMs. You can also install **Snort** or **Suricata** to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.

- **Splunk:** Download from [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com).
- **ELK Stack:** Download from [Elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/).
- **Suricata/Snort:** Install from their respective websites to set up your IDS/IPS.

## üîê **Best Practices for Security & Testing**

### **1. Snapshots & Backups:**
- Before running any offensive tools (like Metasploit), take **VM snapshots** to save your systems‚Äô current state.
- Regularly backup important data, especially configuration files and logs.

### **2. Network Segmentation:**
- Always segment your networks to prevent a compromised VM from spreading to others.
- Use **VLANs** or **bridged networks** for traffic isolation.

### **3. Testing Techniques:**
- **Penetration Testing:** Use Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Nmap to scan, exploit, and test vulnerabilities in your target systems.
- **Network Monitoring:** Use Wireshark to capture and inspect network packets. Analyze traffic and try to identify potential attacks.
- **IDS/IPS Testing:** Use Snort or Suricata to simulate attacks and monitor how well your firewall detects and prevents them.
